 1. Scripts Not Working - I'm trying to import files to the executer / trying to import but can't see the files.

This may be because of the fact that SOME files are not in lua extension but are in .txt extension. If your executer supports just .lua files then you SHOULD copy the code in the file and pasting it into the executer.

 2. Scripts Not Working - I'm doing anything to make them work but they don't whatever I do.
 
 1- make sure that you didn't change anything in the script.
 2- check if there are websites linked to it and if they're online and it doesn't give errors like: "404 not found" or anything else when you enter the site. If It does, then please DM me from discord a text that includes;

     1-Name of the file.
     2-What is the problem.

More info about 2: [What is the problem.] (patched if the website works and the code doesn't work in game or says something like: "kicked from the server due to "client" or something when you run the code and source code is not online anymore if the site that lends you to has got a error like 404 or anything else.

> *more errors will be written here when they get discovered, please don't be shy at letting us know more errors or if you have got a
> problem and wanna say us. We'll help you as much as we can.*
